    "In rhe 1980s, the Nuu-chah-nulth people on Vancouver Island donated over 800 vials of blood to researchers at the University of British Columbia to study rheumatoid arthritis, a condition prevalent in their community. The researcher who collected the samples left his institution, taking the samples with him. The researcher shared them with other researchers for studies unrelated to the original consent, specifically for genetic anthropology, migration patterns, and studies on retroviruses. The donors were not informed that their samples were used for these extra studies, causing a profound breach of trust and highlighting a disregard for informed consent. "

Blood samples were collected with the notion that they were only going to be used to find the genetic basis of the diabetes epidemic within their own community. Without the tribes consent, researchers used blood samples for more studies on schizophrenia, metabolic disorders, and tracing the tribe's geographical origin. Because the researchers did not ask for consent to further their research topics, naturally the tribe felt violated and betrayed so they sued the ASU board and in turn got $700,000 in damages, blood samples were returned, etc. "
